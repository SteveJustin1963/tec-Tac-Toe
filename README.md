TTT typically refers to "Tic-Tac-Toe," which is a classic paper-and-pencil game played on a grid of 3x3 squares. The game is also known as "Noughts and Crosses" or "Xs and Os" in some regions. The objective of Tic-Tac-Toe is to form a line of three matching symbols, either X or O, horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

Here are the basic rules of Tic-Tac-Toe:

1. The game is played on a 3x3 grid, creating nine cells.
2. Two players participate, one using X and the other using O.
3. The players take turns placing their symbol in an empty cell.
4. The starting player is usually chosen randomly or by agreement.
5. Once a cell is marked, it cannot be changed or overwritten.
6. The game continues until one player achieves a winning condition or the board is full.
7. A winning condition is achieved when a player gets three of their symbols in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
8. If all the cells are filled and no player has won, the game ends in a draw.

Tic-Tac-Toe is a relatively simple game, and with optimal play from both players, it always results in a draw. Because of this, it is often used as an introductory game for teaching basic strategy and critical thinking. Despite its simplicity, Tic-Tac-Toe has been widely enjoyed by people of all ages and is commonly played both on paper and in digital formats.
